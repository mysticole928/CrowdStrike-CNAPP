Updated: 2024-10-22

Added information about the Falcon KAC installation process.

## No Warranty Implied or Otherwise

These are my *personal* notes, insights, and refelctions from working with CrowdStrike Falcon.

They are presented "as is" and could _easily_ be out of date.  

All information in this repository came from public-facing documentation.

_Unless I forgot to do it_, links to that public-facing documentation are included and sources are cited.  (_Because giving people credit for their efforts is always the right thing to do._)

The annotations are for those new to Falcon, Kubernetes, and cloud computing.
