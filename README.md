# CrowdStrike CNAPP Notes and Observations

_Updated: 2024-01-22_

I've renamed this repo because some of my notes are going to include information about CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) along with CWP (Cloud Workload Protection) inside Falcon.

Eventually, this will include ASPM, Application Security Posture Management.  ASPM is agentless application discovery and mapping for cloud-based workloads that includes a real-time inventory into every microservice, database, API, and dependencies.

These are my *personal* notes, insights, and refelctions from working with CrowdStrike Falcon.

All of these materials come from public-facing documentation.  Most of the annotations are for people that are new to Falcon, Kubernetes, and cloud computing.
